Dear Rainer , 
 
Thank you for your patience and understanding while we updated our 
www.matrikonopc.com website infrastructure to serve you better. We apologize for any 
inconvenience we may have caused you if you were unable to access educational 
content, sign-up for upcoming webcasts, and/or download or buy OPC software due to 
the longer than expected outages we experienced during the upgrade.  
 
Matrikon continues to be committed to providing you with the best experience possible 
in every interaction with us, no matter if it is online, using our software, or dealing with 
our live support.  
 
Now, with our website infrastructure update complete, I sincerely invite you to visit us 
online once more in case there was anything you needed during our down-time.  
 
If you have any questions or comments regarding this matter, please feel free to discuss 
it directly with your account manager or contact me directly. 
 
Warm regards, 
 
Jason Fletcher 
Business Leader / Matrikon
